## Key: Development Mindset

**As you work on this project, think this way:**

> "What would a developer who has been working on this codebase for 6 months do?"

**They would:**
1. Prioritize searching for similar code
2. Copy existing patterns
3. Ask only when no patterns exist
4. Never introduce new libraries/frameworks without asking

**They would not:**
1. Write code in a completely different style
2. Use different libraries for the same purpose
3. Create new architectural patterns
4. Ignore existing conventions

## Technology Stack and Patterns

### Front-End
- **Framework**:
- **Language**:
- **Style**:

**Pattern**: Search for existing components and copy their structure

### Back-End
- **Framework**:
- **ORM**:
- **Validation**:

**Pattern**: Controller → Service → Repository (Three-Tier Architecture)

### How to verify that you are following the pattern?

Example:
**Simple test:**
grep -r "import.*from.*react" src/ # Should find React imports
grep -r "import.*from.*vue" src/ # Should find nothing

If the code you're about to write doesn't pass this test, stop and ask.

## Quick Start Checklist

Before you start coding:

- [ ] I've read the entire document
- [ ] I've searched the codebase for similar implementations
- [ ] I understand the architecture (Controllers → Services → Codebase)
- [ ] I know which libraries to use (React, Prisma, Zod, etc.)
- [ ] I copy existing patterns and won't innovate

If any of the boxes are unchecked, spend another 5 minutes checking them before coding.

# 🚀 Development Task Execution

Please follow these steps to develop:

1. Read `apox-docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to understand the project context.
2. Read `apox-docs/IMPL_BACKLOG.md` for all task details.
3. Complete all development tasks in the order specified in IMPL_BACKLOG.md.

**Execution Rules**:
- Strictly follow the development guidelines in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
- After completing each task, you must notify me that "Task [Task-ID] is completed" (e.g., "Task [T001-0] is completed").
- If you encounter any problems, refer to the acceptance criteria in IMPL_BACKLOG.md.

Start executing!
